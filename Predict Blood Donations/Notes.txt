Without using feature scaling and no regularization, computation error was seen ('overflow error'). Achieved accuracy on test set was ~75%. 
Feature scaling resolved the error but no marked improvement was seen in the accuracy. 

Using a 5-fold CV method and 3000 iterations, train accuracy reached about 78%, while 80% accuracy was seen for test data. Increasing the 
numberof iterations did not increase accuracy. Same for 10-fold CV.

Using n-fold CV gave an accuracy of 76% on the entire dataset


-> Normalizing using mean and variance gives the same accuracy.



2) Using boosting, the accuracy improved to 79.6% (For 5000 iterations). On train data, the accuracy is about 83%. The 1R (decision tree stump) library from python scitlearn was used. Need to do some more tests on this to check if accuracy can be improved further or not.

3) Using KNN approach (default package), building from scratch gives accuracy of 77% on an average.
