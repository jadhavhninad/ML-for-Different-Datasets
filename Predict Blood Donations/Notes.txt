Without using feature scaling and no regularization, computation error was seen ('overflow error'). Achieved accuracy on test set was ~75%. 
Feature scaling resolved the error but no marked improvement was seen in the accuracy. 

Using a 5-fold CV method and 3000 iterations, train accuracy reached about 78%, while 80% accuracy was seen for test data. Increasing the 
numberof iterations did not increase accuracy. Same for 10-fold CV.

Using n-fold CV gave an accuracy of 76% on the entire dataset


-> Normalizing using mean and variance gives the same accuracy.
